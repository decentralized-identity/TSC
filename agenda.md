# DIF Technical Steering Committee - meeting minutes


_This is a Technical Steering Committee call. Only active members of the TSC (as described in the Operating Addendum extension) and invited guests shall attend the meeting._

_For this call, you are encouraged to turn your video on. This is a good way to build rapport given we are a large, disparate group experiencing a lot of churn._

_The term "WG" stands for Working Group_

## Meeting - 24 November 2021 - (1300 ET)

### present: Kyle, Juan, Sam, Troy, Kaliya, Paul, Dmitri, Rouven, Chris, Balazs

- DIF updates 
- Profiles discussion
    - if its a subset of specs - then its easy to manage
    - they could live under one group - that can be the introp group itself
    - Having a clear definition of a profile is useful to decide if it is/needs to be covered by IPR
        - defines new ideas, then its not an introp profile but a work item to be IPR protected (and refined)
        - if its NOT defining new ideas, ie it only uses subsets of specs, then its interop profile
    -   How to accept such proposals?
        -   They do not technically need IPR protection (they are not specs)  if they are truly “profiles” in classical sense ([example](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2018/06/25/draft_interoperability_profile_description_final.pdf))
        -   Divert/branch-out/export work that crosses over into upstream proposals and new specifications
    -   Does the TSC need to review the profiles before DIF accepts it? 
        -   TSC help decide whether something needs IPR/is a pure profile IF THERE IS A DISPUTE
    -   Who maintains these profiles? What should be the ask? 
        -   Interop WG if true profiles, specific WGs if includes specification work (or relates just to the specific WG)?
    -   Should the WG that wants it adopt it?
        -   Default to Interop WG?
    -   What should be the process?
        -   Interop WG first port of call if spans multiple WG scopes
            -   Make sure upstream suggestions and PRs and iterations move to their upstream venues, whichever DIF WG the work happens in...
        -   Put it on the TSC agenda if two groups want it, or donors/initiators are uncomfortable with IPR boundaries, etc
    -   How relate to profiles articulated elsewhere? CCG has SVIP profile (VC-API) and TOIP had the TIPs…
        -   Sam: DIF is a good place to collate/donate them...
- [Chair Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12_kr9auwOtLXX3YbIp3yVhGQAhZ_BIUF3u_D7HOVIV4/edit#heading=h.pygt7f46dcl9)
- DIF Discord
    - Testing with DIDcomm User Group (Sam) for now
    - Proposed to have tooling maybe for matrix
    - Should DIF listen to its users and make sure that the tools DIF uses is supported by the community? 
- F2F timing - shortly discussed,
    - 26th Jan    
    - 23rd Feb

### Agenda

* A reminder of the upcoming IIW conference
* [Discuss the language to clarify participation and voting mechanism](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/TSC/pull/1) 
* Work item donation discussion
    * Who can donate?
    * What can be donated?
    * Would DIF just accept any work item, or there is a review process?
    * Accepting donation can be liberal, but the donor should align first with the similar work item (or WG) before attempting to donate
* Who makes the final decision to donate?
    * TSC might be the place to review planned donations
        * Including encouraging the donor to align with similar work items already in DIF before donation happens
* What are Interop profiles?
    * DIF values should represent "umbrella" and not selecting certain technologies
    * Interop Profiles might not affect IPR related questions
* WG chair note-taking practices
    * if WG chairs have a hard time to lead and take notes, they should consider collaborating with the community
* In case of chairs failing to adhere to their responsibilities
    * Chairs in this situation can ask for support/tips from chairs of other WGs
    * Notification to be sent to the chairs reminding them of their duties, or their chair roles will be withdrawn and the group will elect new chairs
