# DIF Technical Steering Committee - meeting minutes


_This is a Technical Steering Committee call. Only active members of the TSC (as described in the Operating Addendum extension) and invited guests shall attend the meeting._

_For this call, you are encouraged to turn your video on. This is a good way to build rapport given we are a large, disparate group experiencing a lot of churn._

_The term "WG" stands for Working Group_



## Meeting - 22 September 2021 - (1300 ET)

## Present
- Troy R, Alen H, Martin R, Bernt Z, Daniel M, Daniel B, Dmitri Z, Sam C, Markus S,
- _invited: Balazs N, Chris K, Juan C,_

### Agenda

* A reminder of the upcoming IIW conference
* [Discuss the language to clarify participation and voting mechanism](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/TSC/pull/1) 
* Work item donation discussion
    * Who can donate?
    * What can be donated?
    * Would DIF just accept any work item, or there is a review process?
    * Accepting donation can be liberal, but the donor should align first with the similar work item (or WG) before attempting to donate
* Who makes the final decision to donate?
    * TSC might be the place to review planned donations
        * Including encouraging the donor to align with similar work items already in DIF before donation happens
* What are Interop profiles?
    * DIF values should represent "umbrella" and not selecting certain technologies
    * Interop Profiles might not affect IPR related questions
* WG chair note-taking practices
    * if WG chairs have a hard time to lead and take notes, they should consider collaborating with the community
* In case of chairs failing to adhere to their responsibilities
    * Chairs in this situation can ask for support/tips from chairs of other WGs
    * Notification to be sent to the chairs reminding them of their duties, or their chair roles will be withdrawn and the group will elect new chairs
